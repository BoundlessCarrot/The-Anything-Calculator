# The Anything Calculator

I wanted to create a (relatively) short piece of code that shows the amazing things you can do with 2 numbers. You can't actually calculate anything, but it was a catchy and nice sounding name, so I went with it. 

To run it, use terminal or whatever CLI you use and run math.py like a normal python program.
